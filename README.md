**Created for:** CPSC 449 Programming Paradigms

**Description:** This project was to build a simple parser for a jar file using Java Reflection.

**Software/Technologies:**
- Java
- Java Reflection API
- Apache Ant
- Git

**Methodologies:**
- Use Git/Github as version control and collaboration tool
- Automate using Apache Ant as a build automation tool
- Make use of Java Reflection API
- Use UML semantics to help communicate, plan, and design the software

**Overview**

The program is a command line of tool which takes the interpretor jar file and a jar file that contains the class that has all the methods that can be used to run.

Sample run shows that the interpretor is able to display errors and where it occurs if the appropriate method is not found and process using the ones that are found.
